Project 1.

Proposal 1:

I want to create a game similar to the typing challenges of yore with a few changes. 

The game will pit two players against each other, competing for the best time. The game will switch between the players upon correct answer submissions, and will end after each player has completed a predetermined number of rather simple challenges. The player with the lower score, in this case, the total amount of time elapsed during their turn, is the winner. 

An alternate game style would include the same type of challenges, but in this instance, the timer counts down to zero. The player who's turn it is when time runs out is the loser. A sort of digital Hot Potato, if you will.
